This script mangles the content of incoming mail and resends them. It
is intended as a filter for outgoing mail from e.g. RT. It should be
called from /etc/aliases of a normal UNIX MTA such as postfix.


Example usage:

----{/etc/aliases}----
vendor-headsup: |"/usr/local/bin/mail-mangler.py /etc/mail-mangler.vendor.config"
board-headsup: |"/usr/local/bin/mail-mangler.py /etc/mail-mangler.board.config"
----{/etc/aliases}----

This will create two email aliases, vendor-headsup@localhost and
board-headsup@localhost, that will mangle and resend mails according
to two different config files.

It can be usefull to create a "user" in RT for each of these to ease
the usage. Create the users as usual and set their email adresses to
one of the above. Make sure to set the password to some long random
string. It will then be possible to add the aliases as CC on a ticket
by simply writing the user name in the CC field of a ticket.


Note: Make sure to run the command "newaliases" after making changes
to this file

Note: Make sure to specify a new "To" header in the config-files, or
you will be creating a mail loop!
